Hello!

I am building a cookbook! I am super excited to share some of my favorite recipes, and even more excited to show off my HTML knowledge.

My site is going to be a skeleton to begin with as I will just be building out the structure and sharing four recipes. I am passionate about cooking and the bonding that is shared when having a meal, so my goal is to keep this site up to date with any new food ventures I branch off into. This will be a fun and productive way archive m recipe journey as well as my coding journey. I think one recipe a month is a good starting point. 

The first four recipes I will be sharing are: how to make fresh pasta, a sauce to go with said pasta, a how to on pan fried salmon and a peach cobbler. I've recently started to get into fresh pasta making and I had lots of fun, but also a lot of struggles since I am rolling and cutting the pasta by hand. 

Anyway, the main point of my site is to cement my HTML knowledge and carve out my little piece of the internet. I will be using techniques taught in The Odin Projects Foundations course, as well as utilizing git and github to save and publish my site.

I will start my site off with making directories for the main site and the relative sites for the recipes. I will type up my HTML boilerplate and add my various site titles and heading for the different sections on my page. My ingredients will be formatted into unordered lists and the recipe steps will be formatted in an ordered list. Once I knock out my text I will add pictures and links back to the main menu. And sprinkled on top of all of this will be bold and italicized text tastefully placed.

SO, YEAH TIME TO GET CRACKING!
