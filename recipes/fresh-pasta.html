        <h1>Fresh Pasta</h1>
        <p> This is a recipe that has intimiated me for the longest time. The 
            thought of making fresh pasta always seemed like an impossible
            task, until I finally attempted to try. The picture above is my
            second attempt and boy do I have some tips for you.  
        </p>
        <p> My first time making pasta, I forgot the Olive Oil! I might as 
            well have trashed that dough. The dough came out super dry and I had 
            to roll the dough out by hand using a plastic cup. The noodles that dough 
            produced were extremely thick and after cooking them for about 5 minutes 
            or so they were still raw in the middle. 
        </p>
        <p> Round two went by a lot smoother! I remembered the Olive Oil, the 
            consistency was right and I had a rolling pin. The noodles cooked all
            the way through, but some were thicker than others. And the rolling pin 
            worked for the most part but the dough kept folding over itself and 
            created this crease that weakened the structure of the noodle. I'm not sure 
            how to correct the fold over issue, adding more flour so the dough doesn't 
            stick to the rolling pin seemed to help. Also, go slow with the rolling pin.
