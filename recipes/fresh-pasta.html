        <h1>Fresh Pasta</h1>
        <p> This is a recipe that has intimiated me for the longest time. The 
            thought of making fresh pasta always seemed like an impossible
            task, until I finally attempted to try. The picture above is my
            second attempt and boy do I have some tips for you.  
        </p>
        <p> My first time making pasta, I forgot the Olive Oil! I might as 
            well have trashed that dough. The dough came out super dry and I had 
            to roll the dough out by hand using a plastic cup. The noodles that dough 
            produced were extremely thick and after cooking them for about 5 minutes 
            or so they were still raw in the middle. 
        </p>
        <p> Round two went by a lot smoother! I remembered the Olive Oil, the 
            consistency was right and I had a rolling pin. The noodles cooked all
            the way through, but some were thicker than others. And the rolling pin 
            worked for the most part but the dough kept folding over itself and 
            created this crease that weakened the structure of the noodle. I'm not sure 
            how to correct the fold over issue, adding more flour so the dough doesn't 
            stick to the rolling pin seemed to help. Also, go slow with the rolling pin. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour - spooned & leveled</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Equipment: </h2>
        <ul>
            <dl>
                <li><dt>Rolling Pin</dt></li>
                <dd> Using a pasta machine or stand mixer with the pasta
                    attachments is recommended, unless you want a work out.</dd>
                <li> Lidded bowl or plastic wrap</li>
                <li> Large Pot</li>
                <li>Large baking sheet</li>
                <li> Colander</li>
                <li>Knife</li>
                <li>Fork</li>
            </dl>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dump the flour onto a clean counter and create a liitle 
            bowl right in the center of the pile using the fork.</li>
            <li> Once your bowl is created add the eggs, olive oil and salt, then use the fork to 
            gently beat the eggs.</li>
            <li> Keeping the flour walls intact as best as you can, slowly start to 
            incorporate the flour into the eggs. </li>
            <li>Once half the flour has been incorporated the eggs should be thick enough
            for you to start using your hands. This will be messy. Continue to incorporate
            the flour until the mixture comes together to form a shaggy dough ball.</li>
            <li>Knead your dough ball for 8-10 minutes, it might feel dry at first but it 
            should become cohesive and smooth. If it feels to dry, dip your hand in some water 
            and continue to knead. If the dough is to moist and sticky, sprinkle a little
            flour onto the dough ball and continue to knead. Once desired consistency is 
            achieved, wrap dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest at room temp for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Grab the baking sheet and dust with flour.</li>
            <li> Once dough is rested, cut into 4 pieces.</li>
            <li>Gently flatten out one piece of dough with your hand and slowly start 
            to roll the dough out with the rolling pin. If you are using a pasta machine, 
            run the dough through setting 1 three times. If you are using a rolling pin, roll 
            the dough out to a foot long sheet. When rolling, it is best to dust your work surface 
            and equipment with flour so the dough doesn't stick. But you do not want to over flour
            as this will cause the dough to not stick to itself and when you fold the dough
            it won't come together.</li>
            <li>Fold the sheet in on itself in thirds and then rotate so you have a 
            rectangle to work with.</li>
            <li>Roll with pin until sheet is translucent. If using a machine, pass the 
            sheet three times on setting 2 and 3, then once each on 4, 5 and 6. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle whole sheet with flour and fold in half, flour again, then fold
            in half. And lastly, flour the sheet again and fold it in half resulting in a small 
            rectangle of dough. Place on baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 8-11 for remaining dough pieces.</li>
            <li>After all sheets have been rolled out, grab your knife and gently cut 
            the rolled sheets of dough into your desired pasta width. You can also use any
            pasta cutter attachment. Once pasta has been cut, dust with flour and fold into 
            little nests ready for cooking or storing.</li>
            <li> Cook in boiling water for 2-3 minutes.</li>
