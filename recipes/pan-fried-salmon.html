        <h1>Pan Seared Salmon</h1>
        <p>It doesn't get any more simple than pan searing. While, it is an easy cooking 
            technique to over think, low and slow is the best way to learn. This is another 
            dish to experiment with. Throw different seasonings on the salmon. Try a spicy cajun 
            rub, a rich blend of steak seasoning or something a bit sweeter like a honey glaze.</p>
        <p>But for this recipe I am keeping it basic and rolling with just salt and pepper
            leaving you room for creativity. I love this dish because it is easy to keep 
            healthy, it is really dependent on how you season your salmon filet. You can always
            throw your salmon in the oven or under the broiler for a healthier fish, 
            but that crunchy skin will be absent and to me that is the best part.
