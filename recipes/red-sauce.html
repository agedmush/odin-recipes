        <h1>Red Sauce</h1>
        <p> The red sauce is a perfect pairing with the fresh pasta from the previous 
            recipe. You can really make a red sauce as simple or as complex as you 
            like. I'll be giving out my middle of the road recipe, but the recipe is 
            extremely flexible and forgiving. Meaning, it is difficult to mess up and 
            will be enjoyable 99.9% of the time.
        </p>
        <p>One day, I would love to have my own vegetable and herb garden full of 
            wonderful smells and freshness. After rooting around for pesky weeds all day,
            my wife and son ask me what is for dinner. I look into our basket of veggies that
            we just harvested I see these vibrant, plump red tomatoes still cligning to the vine
            and then I remember the fresh pasta I froze two nights before. I tell them a fresh 
            red sauce is coming. Then my son and I spend the next hour prepping other fresh 
            produce from our garden, such as onions, garlic, mushrooms, parsley and basil. We chop,
            boil, simmer and reduce our way to dinner and our reward is a deliciously rich 
            sauce that is complex in flavor but simple in prepartation. 
        </p>
        <p>My sauce will contain meat but meat is not essential. There will be mushrooms
            as well, please exclude or include any ingredient you would like. Also,
            I am not going to give measurements for a lot of the spices and herbs mixed. 
            This is for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>I don't measure. Cooking is all about feel and smell. If it looks like
                    enough, it probably is enough. (Another golden rule is that you can always 
                    add more, but you can never take any back)
                </li>
                <li>It's season to taste when it comes to herbs, spices, salt and pepper
                    especially in a sauce like this. So add with caustion, but dont be afraid
                    to accomodate your taste buds. I recommend adding maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of each,
                    stirring and then working up from there. Go easy with the pepper and salt, though.
                    We'll be adding red chili flakes as wel if that is your jam.

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by chopping the basil, onion and garlic cloves. Take half of the 
                sliced mushrooms and mince them.</li>

            <li>After the italian sausage has browned completely, add the tomato paste 
                and cook for 3-5 minutes till the paste coats the meat. The vegetables added
                should have become a paste.
            </li>
            <li>Next, add the remaining whole and crushed tomatoes as well as the beef broth,
